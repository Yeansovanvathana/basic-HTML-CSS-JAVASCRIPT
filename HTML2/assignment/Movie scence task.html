	<pre style="font-size:160%;">
	You thought yourself worthy?
	You thought yourself a king?
	You dishonor this place
	with your presence.
	Stop!
	You're right.
	I am a half-breed mongrel.
	But I did not come here
	because I thought I was worthy.
	I know I'm not.
	You understand me?
	I do.
	No mortal has conversed
	with me since King Atlan.
	Who are you?
	I'm nobody.
	I came because
	I had no choice.
	I came to save my home
	and the people that I love.
	I came because the trident
	is their only hope.
	And if that's not
	good enough...
	Then screw you.
	No man has ever freed
	the trident from Atlan's grip.
	Should he deem you unworthy...
	Well, I haven't feasted
	in eons,
	and I am famished.
	(GASPS)
	(YELLING)
	The one true king.
