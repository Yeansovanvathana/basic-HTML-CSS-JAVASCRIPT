<p>In the past, a strong wood cutter asked for a job at a lumber yard and he got it. The salary the woodcutter receives is commensurate with the working conditions. That's why cutters are determined to do it well.

His boss gives him a sharp ax and shows him where to cut it.



On the first day, he cut 18 pieces of wood.

“That's great!” The boss exclaimed, “keep on trying!”

The words of praise from the boss are a strong motivator. The next day, the woodcutter worked hard, but he only cut 15 trees. The next day, the man worked even harder, but he could only cut 10 trees. The next day he cut less and less, despite his best efforts.

He said in his heart, "I may have lost my strength." He also went to his boss and apologized. He did not know the reason why he couldn't cut much, no matter how hard he tried.

“When did you last clear your ax?” The boss asked him.

"Fine? I have no time to polish my ax. I was busy trying to cut the wood.

The education: Our lives are too. Sometimes we are so busy that we can't even have time to enjoy it. In today's world, it seems like everyone's getting busier, but less fun.

Why? Could it be that we have forgotten to live in happiness? It's not wrong for people to be busy and work hard. But we should not be too busy to ignore the realities of life, such as our own lives, spending more time with parents, spending more time with family, or spending time learning something new.
